## Go
TEST
A complete Sequence SDK is also available in Go: https://github.com/0xsequence/go-sequence.

[go-sequence](https://github.com/0xsequence/go-sequence) is the equivalent of [0xsequence](https://github.com/0xsequence/sequence.js)
but for Go / Golang backends. In fact, all of Sequence's infrastructure is written in Go and is built with [go-sequence](https://github.com/0xsequence/go-sequence).


## ethkit

As part of the Sequence open source tools, our team has also built [ethkit](https://github.com/0xsequence/ethkit), which
is an Ethereum dev toolkit for Go backends. [ethkit](https://github.com/0xsequence/ethkit) supports EOA wallets,
and you can think of it like `ethers.js` but for Go.
