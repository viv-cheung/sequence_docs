## es-translated Text Formatting
MOCKDATA + es-translated We support most markdown formatting. Simply add `**`, `_`, or `~` around text to format it.

| es-translated Style                    | MOCKDATA + es-translated How to write it | es-translated Result                       |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| MOCKDATA + es-translated Bold          | es-translated `**bold**`                 | MOCKDATA + es-translated **bold**          |
| es-translated Italic                   | MOCKDATA + es-translated `_italic_`      | es-translated _italic_                     |
| MOCKDATA + es-translated Strikethrough | es-translated `~strikethrough~`          | MOCKDATA + es-translated ~~strikethrough~~ |

es-translated You can combine these. For example, write `**_bold and italic_**` to get **_bold and italic_** text.

MOCKDATA + es-translated You need to use HTML to write superscript and subscript text. That is, add `<sup>` or `<sub>` around your text.

| es-translated Text Size              | MOCKDATA + es-translated How to write it        | es-translated Result                            |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| MOCKDATA + es-translated Superscript | es-translated `<sup>superscript</sup>`          | MOCKDATA + es-translated <sup>superscript</sup> |
| es-translated Subscript              | MOCKDATA + es-translated `<sub>subscript</sub>` | es-translated <sub>subscript</sub>              |

## MOCKDATA + es-translated Linking to Pages
es-translated You can add a link by wrapping text in `[]()`. You would write `[link to google](https://google.com)` to [link to google](https://google.com).

MOCKDATA + es-translated Links to pages in your docs need to be root-relative. Basically, you should include the entire folder path. For example, `[link to text](/writing-content/text)` links to the page "Text" in our components section.

es-translated Relative links like `[link to text](../text)` will open slower because we cannot optimize them as easily.
