ja-translated The navigation menu is the list of links on every website.

MOCKDATA + ja-translated You will likely update `docs.json` every time you add a new page. Pages do not show up automatically.

## ja-translated Navigation syntax
MOCKDATA + ja-translated Our navigation syntax is recursive which means you can make nested navigation groups. You don't need to include `.mdx` in page names.

<CodeGroup>
  ```json Regular Navigation!!
  "navigation": {
    "tabs": [
      {
        "tab": "Docs",
        "groups": [
          {
            "group": "Getting Started",
            "pages": ["quickstart"]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

  ```json Nested Navigation
  "navigation": {
    "tabs": [
      {
        "tab": "Docs",
        "groups": [
          {
            "group": "Getting Started",
            "pages": [
              "quickstart",
              {
                "group": "Nested Reference Pages",
                "pages": ["nested-reference-page"]
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## ja-translated Folders
ja-translated Simply put your .mdx files in folders and update the paths in `docs.json`.

MOCKDATA + ja-translated For example, to have a page at `https://yoursite.com/your-folder/your-page` you would make a folder called `your-folder` containing an MDX file called `your-page.mdx`.

<Warning>
  ja-translated You cannot use `api` for the name of a folder unless you nest it inside another folder. Mintlify uses Next.js which reserves the top-level `api` folder for internal server calls. A folder name such as `api-reference` would be accepted.
</Warning>

```json Navigation With Folder
"navigation": {
  "tabs": [
    {
      "tab": "Docs",
      "groups": [
        {
          "group": "Group Name",
          "pages": ["your-folder/your-page"]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## MOCKDATA + ja-translated Hidden Pages
ja-translated MDX files not included in `docs.json` will not show up in the sidebar but are accessible through the search bar and by linking directly to them.
