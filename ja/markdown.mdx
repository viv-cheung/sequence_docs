## ja-translated Text Formatting
MOCKDATA + ja-translated We support most markdown formatting. Simply add `**`, `_`, or `~` around text to format it.

| ja-translated Style                    | MOCKDATA + ja-translated How to write it | ja-translated Result                       |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| MOCKDATA + ja-translated Bold          | ja-translated `**bold**`                 | MOCKDATA + ja-translated **bold**          |
| ja-translated Italic                   | MOCKDATA + ja-translated `_italic_`      | ja-translated _italic_                     |
| MOCKDATA + ja-translated Strikethrough | ja-translated `~strikethrough~`          | MOCKDATA + ja-translated ~~strikethrough~~ |

ja-translated You can combine these. For example, write `**_bold and italic_**` to get **_bold and italic_** text.

MOCKDATA + ja-translated You need to use HTML to write superscript and subscript text. That is, add `<sup>` or `<sub>` around your text.

| ja-translated Text Size              | MOCKDATA + ja-translated How to write it        | ja-translated Result                            |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| MOCKDATA + ja-translated Superscript | ja-translated `<sup>superscript</sup>`          | MOCKDATA + ja-translated <sup>superscript</sup> |
| ja-translated Subscript              | MOCKDATA + ja-translated `<sub>subscript</sub>` | ja-translated <sub>subscript</sub>              |

## MOCKDATA + ja-translated Linking to Pages
ja-translated You can add a link by wrapping text in `[]()`. You would write `[link to google](https://google.com)` to [link to google](https://google.com).

MOCKDATA + ja-translated Links to pages in your docs need to be root-relative. Basically, you should include the entire folder path. For example, `[link to text](/writing-content/text)` links to the page "Text" in our components section.

ja-translated Relative links like `[link to text](../text)` will open slower because we cannot optimize them as easily.
